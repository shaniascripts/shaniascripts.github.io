Today I completed **Module 1** of Meta’s *Front-End Developer Professional Certificate* on Coursera.  
This module introduced the foundations of web development and the key tools used to build modern websites.

### 🫷😵‍💫🫸What I Learned
- The difference between **front-end** and **back-end** development  
- How websites work and how browsers render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- The importance of accessibility and responsive design  
- An overview of developer tools like VS Code and Chrome DevTools

### ✨Practice Highlights
I built a simple “Hello World” webpage using HTML and experimented with headings, paragraphs, and lists.  
It was my first time writing real code in a web editor — and it felt amazing to see the page appear in my browser!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first front-end project.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```html
