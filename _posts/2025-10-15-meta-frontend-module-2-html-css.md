title: "Meta Front-End Developer â€“ Module 2: HTML and CSS in Depth"
date: 2025-10-15
---

Today I started **Module 2** of Metaâ€™s *Front-End Developer Professional Certificate* on Coursera â€” and itâ€™s already way more hands-on! ðŸ’»  

This module dives deep into **HTML** and **CSS**, showing how these two languages work together to bring web pages to life.

### ðŸ§± What I Learned Today
- The structure of an HTML document (head, body, tags, and attributes)  
- How to style text, colors, and layouts using CSS  
- The importance of semantic tags for accessibility  
- Linking external stylesheets and using inline vs. internal CSS

### ðŸŽ¨ What I Practiced
I built my first structured webpage with HTML headings, paragraphs, links, and images â€” and then added CSS to change the colors and fonts.  
Hereâ€™s a small example I made during practice:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Practice Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first page with custom colors and fonts!</p>
    <a href="https://shaniascripts.github.io">Visit my blog</a>
  </body>
</html>
