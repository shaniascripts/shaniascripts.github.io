Today I completed **Module 1** of Course 1 in Metaâ€™s *Front-End Developer Professional Certificate* on Coursera.  
This module introduced the foundations of web development and the key tools used to build modern websites.

### ðŸ¤­ What I Learned
- The difference between **undefined** **null** and **empty** strings
- How to use objects, arrays and functions
- The most common built-in methods
- Describe handling bugs and errors using try, catch, throw, and defensive programming
- The differences between switch and if-else statements

### ðŸ¤ª Practice Highlights
I worked on learning how exactly to create and run a if-else and switch statement, honestly the switch statements were the most fun part to me, 
it made it super easy to get everything down and really understandable! Excited to get more into this and learn what 'else' I can do 'if' I continue. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
